## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The source code of the layouts lives in the [`src/pages/`](src/pages/) subfolder.

At its root, this repository is an [Astro](https://astro.build) publication, that is automatically published by Vercel on commits, to allow browsing the layout templates online.

You can preview the Astro publication by running `npm start` after installing the deps. The publication was generated by running the following command:

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template basics
```

Inside of the Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
